Description: Blackfriday: a markdown processor for Go version 2
 Blackfriday (github.com/russross/blackfriday) is a Markdown processor
 implemented in Go. It is paranoid about its input (so you can safely feed it
 user-supplied data), it is fast, it supports common extensions (tables, smart
 punctuation substitutions, etc.), and it is safe for all utf-8 (unicode)
 input.
 .
 HTML output is currently supported, along with Smartypants extensions. An
 experimental LaTeX output engine is also included.
 .
 It started as a translation from C of upskirt.
 .
 This package contains the 'v2' branch, which is largly, but not fully, source
 compatible with the golang-github-russross-blackfriday-dev package
